As London continues to expand and modernise its transport infrastructure, one major change set to impact thousands of daily commuters and businesses is the introduction of tolls at the [**Silvertown Tunnel** **Blackwall Tunnel**](https://www.minicabs.co.uk/blog/silvertown-blackwall-tunnel-charge/) Whether you’re a local resident, private hire driver, or delivery operator, understanding how the **Blackwall Tunnel charge** and the **Silvertown Tunnel charge** work is essential for planning your journeys and avoiding unexpected costs.

This comprehensive guide explains what the tolls are, who’s affected, how to **pay Blackwall Tunnel charges**, and what it means for travel across East London.

## **Why Are Tunnel Charges Being Introduced in East London?**

The **Blackwall Tunnel**, which connects Greenwich to Tower Hamlets under the River Thames, is one of London’s busiest river crossings. Originally opened in 1897 (and later expanded), it was not designed to handle today’s traffic volumes, leading to regular congestion, delays, and air quality concerns.

To tackle this, **Transport for London (TfL)** is opening the **Silvertown Tunnel** in 2025—a modern twin-bore tunnel that will offer an additional river crossing near the Blackwall Tunnel. Both tunnels will operate under the same **toll system** to:

* Manage congestion
    
* Reduce emissions
    
* Fund construction and maintenance costs
    
* Promote sustainable transport options
    

This means drivers using either tunnel will now face charges.

## **Blackwall Tunnel Charge – What You Need to Know**

From 2025, for the first time ever, drivers will need to **pay a toll to use the Blackwall Tunnel**.

### **Key Information:**

* Applies **24/7**, every day of the year
    
* Charges vary based on **vehicle type** and **time of day**
    
* Operates with **ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)** – no booths
    
* Managed through the same system as Silvertown Tunnel toll
    

### **Estimated Toll Rates (Subject to Confirmation by TfL)**

| Vehicle Type | Peak Hours\* | Off-Peak Hours\* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Car (Private Use) | £4.00 | £2.50 |
| Motorcycle | £1.00 | £0.50 |
| Van (Small Commercial) | £6.00 | £4.00 |
| HGV / Lorry | £10.00 | £7.00 |
| Private Hire Vehicle | £4.00 | £2.50 |

\*Peak hours expected to be 6:30 AM – 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM – 7:00 PM (Mon–Fri). Final times may

vary.**Silvertown Tunnel Charge – Same Rules, New Tunnel**

The **Silvertown Tunnel**, currently under construction, will connect the Royal Docks on the north bank with the Greenwich Peninsula on the south. It is designed to ease pressure on the Blackwall route and allow for more reliable crossings.

### **Key Points:**

* Opens in **2025**, with **tolls active from day one**
    
* Same charge rates as Blackwall Tunnel to avoid traffic migration
    
* Expected to significantly reduce congestion for East Londoners
    
* Includes dedicated bus lanes to support public transport
    

Like its counterpart, the **Silvertown Tunnel charge** will also use ANPR, requiring all drivers to pre-pay or register for automatic billing.

## **How to Pay Blackwall Tunnel and Silvertown Tunnel Charges**

To **pay Blackwall Tunnel toll** or the **Silvertown Tunnel charge**, drivers must use TfL online systems. There will be **no physical toll booths**, similar to how the Dartford Crossing and Congestion Charge operate.

### **Payment Options:**

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Auto Pay | Link your vehicle and pay automatically. Discount may apply for subscribers |
| TfL Online Portal | Pay by card up to 3 days after the journey |
| TfL Mobile App | Track journeys, make payments, and manage vehicles |
| Customer Service Phone | Call TfL to pay or make an inquiry |

Failure to pay will result in **Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs)**, which can be costly—so timely payment is crucial.

## **Discounts and Exemptions – Who Gets Relief?**

TfL is expected to offer **discounts or exemptions** for certain groups to ease the burden on locals and essential services.

### **Possible Exemptions/Discounts:**

| Group | Status (Expected) |
| --- | --- |
| Local residents | Up to 50% discount (subject to criteria) |
| Blue Badge holders | Full exemption |
| Electric vehicles (EVs) | Likely discounted or exempt |
| Buses and emergency vehicles | Fully exempt |
| Licensed taxis | Exempt |
| Private hire vehicles | Not exempt unless EV |

Please refer to the TfL website for the final, confirmed list of exemptions when the scheme launches.

## **Why This Matters for Local Residents and Businesses**

For many in East and Southeast London, this toll system introduces an additional cost to daily travel. Those working in central London, commuting across boroughs, or running local businesses will need to:

* Adjust travel budgets
    
* Plan alternative routes
    
* Consider using public transport
    
* Factor tolls into service prices (e.g., minicabs or delivery services)
    

Businesses like **courier companies, removals services, and private hire operators** will need to build the charges into quotes or operations.

Minicabs.co.uk, for example, will ensure all quotes involving tunnel crossings include tolls transparently.

## **What Can You Do Now to Prepare?**

1. **Register for TfL Auto Pay** – Get notified when the scheme goes live and avoid fines.
    
2. **Monitor Official Updates** – Toll prices and policies may be revised.
    
3. **Check Vehicle Eligibility** – EV owners and Blue Badge holders may be eligible for savings.
    
4. **Consider Public Transport** – The Jubilee Line, DLR, or Thames Clippers may be better for short or frequent crossings.
    
5. **Plan Off-Peak Journeys** – Off-peak tolls are cheaper, helping reduce cost.
    

## **Conclusion: Navigating Tunnel Charges in 2025**

The new **Blackwall Tunnel charge** and **Silvertown Tunnel charge** mark a significant change for London's road users. While the introduction of tolls will add costs for many, the long-term goal is to improve traffic flow, reduce pollution, and support a more sustainable London.

If you regularly cross the Thames via East London, staying informed and planning ahead will help you avoid disruption and manage expenses. With clear payment systems, potential discounts, and multiple transport alternatives, Londoners can adapt effectively to this evolving infrastructure.
