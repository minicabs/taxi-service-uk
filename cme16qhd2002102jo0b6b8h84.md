As London continues to expand and modernize its transport infrastructure, one major change set to impact thousands of daily commuters and businesses is the introduction of tolls at the **Silvertown Tunnel** **Blackwall Tunnel** Whether you’re a local resident, private hire driver, or delivery operator, understanding how the [**Blackwall Tunnel charge**](https://www.minicabs.co.uk/blog/silvertown-blackwall-tunnel-charge/) and the **Silvertown Tunnel charge** work is essential for planning your journeys and avoiding unexpected costs.

This comprehensive guide explains what the tolls are, who’s affected, how to **pay Blackwall Tunnel charges**, and what it means for travel across East London.

## **Why Are Tunnel Charges Being Introduced in East London?**

The **Blackwall Tunnel**, which connects Greenwich to Tower Hamlets under the River Thames, is one of London’s busiest river crossings. Originally opened in 1897 (and later expanded), it was not designed to handle today’s traffic volumes, leading to regular congestion, delays, and air quality concerns.

To tackle this, **Transport for London (TfL)** is opening the **Silvertown Tunnel** in 2025 a modern twin-bore tunnel that will offer an additional river crossing near the Blackwall Tunnel. Both tunnels will operate under the same **toll system** to:

* Manage congestion
    
* Reduce emissions
    
* Fund construction and maintenance costs
    
* Promote sustainable transport options
    

This means drivers using either tunnel will now face charges.

## **Blackwall Tunnel Charge – What You Need to Know**

From 2025, for the first time ever, drivers will need to **pay a toll to use the Blackwall Tunnel**.

### **Key Information:**

## **Why This Matters for Local Residents and Businesses**

For many in East and Southeast London, this toll system introduces an additional cost to daily travel. Those working in central London, commuting across boroughs, or running local businesses will need to:

* Adjust travel budgets
    
* Plan alternative routes
    
* Consider using public transport
    
* Factor tolls into service prices (e.g., minicabs or delivery services)
    

Businesses like **courier companies, removals services, and private hire operators** will need to build the charges into quotes or operations.

Minicabs.co.uk, for example, will ensure all quotes involving tunnel crossings include tolls transparently.

1. **Register for TfL Auto Pay** – Get notified when the scheme goes live and avoid fines.
    
2. **Monitor Official Updates** – Toll prices and policies may be revised.
    
3. **Check Vehicle Eligibility** – EV owners and Blue Badge holders may be eligible for savings.
    
4. **Consider Public Transport** – The Jubilee Line, DLR, or Thames Clippers may be better for short or frequent crossings.
    
5. **Plan Off-Peak Journeys** – Off-peak tolls are cheaper, helping reduce cost.
